What I'd ideally like this to look like

doesn't necessarily have to be bind operator, but any monadic looking operator could probably work.

```
flag "-a" required empty >>= (ctx, a :: String) ->
flag "-b" required ctx >>= (ctx, b :: String) -> 
flag "-c" required ctx >>= (ctx, c :: Int) ->
putStrLn a >>= putStrLn b >>= putStrLn $ show c

```
